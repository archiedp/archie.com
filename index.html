      <p> Hello!</p> <p> I’m a semi-introverted, highly inexperienced blog- writer and medical student in the UK with a passion for reading and writing. I do have other hobbies, the most prominent ones being debating and sketching, but they’re almost just as irrelevant to my life at this point, as they are to this blog; most of my time is spent either studying or reading. I enjoy writing just about anything- poems, articles and short stories, and hope to share some of my pieces with people who might enjoy reading them. Along with penning down my thoughts, I find summarizing others’ ideas very fruitful for both self- introspection and retention; the ‘Book Notes’ section of this blog is just a capsule of certain books I found interesting and whose core ideas I wish to revisit without having to reread the whole book, multiple times. </p> <p> Since this page is supposed to be exclusively about me, I reckon it’d make sense for me to outline a few of my current aspirations. I want to be a doctor, a path I’ve already embarked upon quite recently. Combining my appreciation for meeting different people and learning from their varied experiences with my immense fascination of the human body, the healthcare world roped me in. Another contributing factor might be my enthusiasm to make at least a small positive change in someone else’s life, something I’ve tried my best practicing as much as I can, leading some of my efforts to be felicitated with the prestigious Diana Award. I am also an avid learner, a trait that helped me immensely throughout school, and along with my co-curricular participation and fulfilment of some social responsibilities, helped me win the Her Highness Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak Award for Excellence, an award set up in the memory of the mother of UAE. </p> <p>The reason I started this blog isn’t something even I recognize completely; it’s just what I felt like doing, in the moment. A plausible explanation could be about me projecting some of my reflections to people who enjoy reading my work, or maybe I just wanted to propagate the same benefits I enjoyed by reading notes of books on other bloggers’ pages. Or perhaps, I just wanted to get into the discipline of writing regularly, a schedule I’m betting on this blog to enforce for me. Anyway, I really hope to be able to communicate some of my thoughts through my pieces and share some of my upcoming adventures with you all! </p>

        <h3> In one line- </h3> <p>"Every female cell can call on its genetic reserves of hundreds of important genes in times of need. Men only wish they could do that."</p> <h3>In 3 lines-</h3> <p> This book does a wonderful job at explaining the genetic superiority of having two X chromosomes (as seen in genetic females) with the help of a wide array of examples. To cover all aspects, he also delves into the few disadvantages associated with it. </article> </section> </section>

        <h1> Mappa del Inferno </h1> <p><em>“Abandon all hope, <br> Ye who enter here.” </em><br> Upon the gates did mope, <br> These words of hellish fear.</p> <p>On the shore lingered, <br> Those who got not hell proper. <br> Yet maggots on them spindled, <br> And wasps stung sharper. </p> <p>The selfish, the opportunist, <br> And the capricious cowards; <br> Their souls hell didn’t twist; <br> Hell this was not to the fire forward. </p> <p>Off he went the vestibule, vile, <br> Screams of some sinned, left, now afar. <br> Ahead lied only the foreboding trial. <br> Goodness, he hoped, his sins didn’t mar. <br> <p>Lonza, the first, prowled on cruelty. <br> “To hell, this is a vital test.” <br> “My hands ne’er red, I promise thee.” <br> Lonza pondered, he moved on to the next. </p> <p>The leopard’s left, Leone to pass through; <br> “The worst of all sins, malice and fraud.” <br> “Treachery I know not, ‘tis true.” <br> Now, the werewolf, he moved on to trod. </p> <p>Lupa, not dear, nor motherly. <br> “For betrayal, even Romulus hath paid.” <br> “I pray, no kin remember me bitterly.” <br> To all the three beasts, his innocence he laid. </p> <p>To all the judges he did plea. <br> Yet, his innocence wasn’t lied more. <br> He could not, now, flee, <br> Hell awaited him afore. </p> <p>Lived he had a life, merry; <br> For himself, he only cared. <br> So his soul to hell to carry; <br> For heaven he had badly fared. </p> <p>Nine rings in all to pass, <br> Where would he be placed? <br> The upper rings, the mass; <br> The lower, the worst only faced. </p> <p>The outermost of all, the limbo thrived; <br> Hell not it was, but heaven neither. <br> Deeper in, the lusty he skived. <br> Life with Helen he wouldn’t mind, either. </p> <p>Gluttony to punish, then ensued; <br> Abstinence, his soul wished, hath approved. <br> Greedy, money grubbers, so pursued; <br> A penny less earned, victorious proved. </p> <p>Worse was wrath; the angry roamed; <br> The fifth ring battled on the Styx. <br> Sixth, then, heretics entombed, <br> With flames, their souls were mixed.</p> <p>Within the seventh lay three more; <br> The blasphemers, suiciders and murderers. <br> The eighth, ten divisions in core; <br> Fraudulent and the perjurers. </p> <p>Final ring, the ninth one of all; <br> Lucifer’s three heads of treachery. <br> Hath Cassius and Brutus to share this fall; <br> Most severe of all was such butchery. </p> <p>Through the burning inferno, <br> His pleasant stroll was over. <br> Judgement: where, didn't know, <br> Which ring was his soul to hover? </p> </article>
