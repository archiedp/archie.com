      <p> Hello!</p> <p> I’m a semi-introverted, highly inexperienced blog- writer and medical student in the UK with a passion for reading and writing. I do have other hobbies, the most prominent ones being debating and sketching, but they’re almost just as irrelevant to my life at this point, as they are to this blog; most of my time is spent either studying or reading. I enjoy writing just about anything- poems, articles and short stories, and hope to share some of my pieces with people who might enjoy reading them. Along with penning down my thoughts, I find summarizing others’ ideas very fruitful for both self- introspection and retention; the ‘Book Notes’ section of this blog is just a capsule of certain books I found interesting and whose core ideas I wish to revisit without having to reread the whole book, multiple times. </p> <p> Since this page is supposed to be exclusively about me, I reckon it’d make sense for me to outline a few of my current aspirations. I want to be a doctor, a path I’ve already embarked upon quite recently. Combining my appreciation for meeting different people and learning from their varied experiences with my immense fascination of the human body, the healthcare world roped me in. Another contributing factor might be my enthusiasm to make at least a small positive change in someone else’s life, something I’ve tried my best practicing as much as I can, leading some of my efforts to be felicitated with the prestigious Diana Award. I am also an avid learner, a trait that helped me immensely throughout school, and along with my co-curricular participation and fulfilment of some social responsibilities, helped me win the Her Highness Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak Award for Excellence, an award set up in the memory of the mother of UAE. </p> <p>The reason I started this blog isn’t something even I recognize completely; it’s just what I felt like doing, in the moment. A plausible explanation could be about me projecting some of my reflections to people who enjoy reading my work, or maybe I just wanted to propagate the same benefits I enjoyed by reading notes of books on other bloggers’ pages. Or perhaps, I just wanted to get into the discipline of writing regularly, a schedule I’m betting on this blog to enforce for me. Anyway, I really hope to be able to communicate some of my thoughts through my pieces and share some of my upcoming adventures with you all! </p>

      <article> <h1> The Better Half </h1> <h2> Sharon Moalem </h2> 
        <h3> In one line- </h3> <p>"Every female cell can call on its genetic reserves of hundreds of important genes in times of need. Men only wish they could do that."</p> <h3>In 3 lines-</h3> <p> This book does a wonderful job at explaining the genetic superiority of having two X chromosomes (as seen in genetic females) with the help of a wide array of examples. To cover all aspects, he also delves into the few disadvantages associated with it. </p> <p> Basic things about Biology (at the end of this page) </p> <h3> Detailed overview- </h3> <p> The author starts out with a few general observations that led him to dive deeper into the genetic comparison of the male and female chromosomal sets. <ul>
<li> A premature female heterozygotic (fraternal) twin has a higher survival rate than her male brother in the NICU </li>
<li> COVID-19 mortality is higher in males despite an equal or higher infection rate in women </li>
<li> Women are generally more sensitive to chemicals, drugs, alcohol, etc. </li>
<li> Higher rates of autoimmune disorders in females. </li>
<li> Higher female survival rates in stressful times like Stalin's collectivisation programme- 8 million people died in 1 year, female mortality lesser than male </li>
<li> Donner party- 1846, a wagon was stuck in a blizzard for days. Female survival greater than male. </li>
<li> Lubek disaster- 251 newborns were injected with contaminated BCG vaccines (for TB).  Survival rate of the female babies was significantly higher. </li> </ul> </p>
<p> Development of males and females- </p>
<p> This is followed by a brief overview on the development of males and females. We start off with bipotential gonads which, in case of genetic males, creates testes under the influence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. Rare case- a genetic XX female presented as a male (with male reproductive organs) due to the duplication of the SOX3 gene, which is the precursor of the SRY gene. </p>
<p> (Nettie Stevens discovered the Y chromosome for the first time in mealworms, but her credit was stolen by a man, Edmund Beecher Wilson- shocker!)</p>
<p>In genetic females, one of the X chromosomes is randomly ‘switched off’ or inactivated with the help of an RNA gene XIST (X inactivation specific transcript). The silenced X chromosome is called a Barr body which cannot create proteins to assert its influence on the body. However, 23% of the genes on the Barr body actually escape inactivation, and thus, females have one whole X ch and 23% of the silenced one. The process of silencing an X ch, as first discovered by Mary F. Lyon, is highly complicated and is usually completed before the mother is even aware of the pregnancy, leading to a lack of extensive research on this process. Moreover, due to its highly complex nature with a high number of error sources, a lot of the babies are spontaneously aborted even before the woman is aware of her pregnancy, causing a lower sex ratio even in regions where social and communal factors are conducive for a girl child. </p>
<p> The process of sex determination in humans is dependent upon which sperm fertilizes the egg, and thus, which chromosome is brought by the father (of you 2 sex ch, one is from your mother -X- and the other, from father - X or Y). In ancient times, while Aristotle discovered the role of the placenta and umbilical cord, he got sex determination hilariously wrong. According to him and his contemporaries, more heat in coitus would produce a male ('baking' a male child). Unfortunately, some still practice this theory and try to raise internal body temperature using pseudoscientific practices, a fairly recent case outlined in the book lead to the birth of a child with congenital anomalies. </p>
<p>Underlying argument- </p>
<p>Women have two X chromosomes, males have one. (the Y chromosome is considerably smaller than the X chromosome and doesn’t contain a lot of essential genes that the X one has).</p>
<p>Now, to understand how having one extra chromosome helps, the author cites the examples of honey bees, whose females have a whole extra SET of chromosomes. The male bees (called drones) have 16 chromosomes while the female bees (queen and worker) have 32 chromosomes total. The drones’ only purpose is to mate with the queen bee who collects and stores sperms and gives birth to the worker and drone bees. The male drones are then kicked out of the hive and left to die. Female worker bees pollinate flowers, collect nectar, secrete enzymes for honey production, flap their wings 11400 times per minute to dehydrate the nectar, make their own antibiotics which we’ve also benefitted from (since honey bees cannot produce antibodies) and they even do a ritual dance to communicate good nectar locations. He later also takes the example of domesticated potatoes, which usually have more than 2 sets of chromosomes (they may be tetraploid or pentaploid), and as opposed to corn and quinoa, they can be grown on higher altitudes with no reduction in yield (observation based in Peru regions). These examples show the genetic strength conferred by whole extra sets of chromosomes. Thus, while human females lack the advantage of having an extra set, they are lucky enough to have at least one extra. 
In birds however, the males show homogamety (they have ZZ chromosomes) while females show heterogamety (ZW). Male birds have been shown to be stronger and genetically superior to female birds, thus, alluding to the human structure of female genetic superiority due to homogamety. </p>
<p>Proof/ examples of the XX genetic superiority- </p>
<p>X chromosomes also contain some immune- related genes, thus having 2 is an immunological advantage. (somatic hypermutation of B cells is higher. As the B cells keep mutating, they keep upgrading the diversity and quality of antibodies they produce). Women are less susceptible to peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Fun story- Earlier, PUD was known to be caused exclusively by stress, but Marshall and Warren discovered that the actual cause was a bacterium called Helicobacter Pylori. People didn’t initially believe them, so Marshall injected the bacterium into his own body, fell sick, got PUD and cured it with a dose of antibiotics, thus proving the bacterial cause. Recently, Estradiol (estrogen type) has been discovered to mediate H. pylori , and since we, women, have bucket loads of that naturally, we’re safer.</p>
<p>Better protected from X linked diseases, as well. Since females have 2 X chromosomes, any bad changes in one can be masked by the other. For example, a man with a defective X chromosome for Hunter’s disease will not be able to metabolize cellular waste properly as the gene IDS on X ch. Produces an enzyme (Iduronate- 2- sulfatase) which is responsible for that. The prognosis of this illness is dire. However, in case of a defective X ch. In females, cellular cooperation is seen. As in, the enzyme produced by the cells that use the healthy X chromosome is shared with the cells that use the defective X chromosome (remember, X inactivation is completely random) through mannose- 6- phosphate mediated endocytosis.</p>
<p> To explain better survival of women chances in stressful situations like famines, females generally tend to have 40% extra body fat than males (mostly in the femoro-gluteal region) and lesser muscle mass (muscles require more oxygen and food than normal body cells), so in adverse conditions or calamities where food is limited, genetic females have a greater chance at survival as their bodies can optimally function with lower intake. </p>
<p> The FMR1 gene  on the X ch. codes for a protein called FMRP (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein) which is responsible for normal cognitive development lies on the X chromosome. So having XX is a decided advantage to reduce the probability of a cognitive disorder. (males have a higher statistic of Autism Spectrum Disorder)</p>
<p>Humans usually have trichromatic vision (3 activated colour genes, 2 of which are on the X chromosome) and can see upto 1 million colours. Due to 23% of genes escaping inactivation, women might just have a few extra advantages at distinguishing different shades. Concetta Antico (artist) however, has a visual superpower as she has tetrachromatic vision (her Barr body also contributed to one colour gene, thus, she has 4), leading her to see 100 million colours. </p>
<p> (Note- the lesser colours you are able to see, the better you are at camouflage breaking. That is why colour blind people are statistically better at seeing through a camouflage; good military recruitment criteria?)</p>
<p>Dr. Han G. Brunner discovered a gene on the X chromosome- MAOA gene (Mono amine oxidase A gene) which secretes an enzyme (mono amine oxidase A) that recycles neurotransmitters like serotonin in your nervous system. A defect in this gene may result in aggressive behaviour. There are 2 main alleles/ types of the gene- MAOA-H (High- more common and normal type) and MAOA-L (low- defective type). The MAOA-L gene is called the 'psycho gene', and while it is recessive to the MAOA-H, it can assert pseudodominance in males who only have 1 X ch.</p>
<p> Women have decidedly participated much better than men in races that require sustained stamina and endurance rather than short bursts of muscle power. Some examples of women winning against men in such races are: <ul>
<li> Courtney Dauwalter won in a 238.3 mile footrace (2 days, 9 hrs, 59 mins) against men </li>
<li> Jasmine Paris won a 268 mile hill marathon (Montane Spine Race), beating the previous (man’s) record by 12 hours, all while stopping 4 times to express breast milk for her 14 month old child </li>
<li> Rebecca Rusch is a 7 times world champion in mountain biking </li>
<li> Fiona Kolbinger won the 2500 mile transcontinental cycling race against 200 men, traversing through the French Alps and adverse weather conditions </li></ul></p>
        <h3> Basic overview about Biology- </h3> <ul> <li> Everything in your body is coded in your DNA (present in each cell of your body) that has functional units called genes. (eg. Gene for eye colour codes for the colour of your eyes) </li> <li> DNA is a huge template of all the information about your body, so it gives instructions to the body by transcribing into smaller structures called RNA that only contain the commands that are required at a particular point in time. The RNA then translates into important proteins which help the body obey the DNA’s orders. </li> <li> There are 2 types of each gene in our body (eg. You might have a gene for brown eyes and green eyes, but one of the two is dominant – brown- so your final eye colour will be brown). </li>  <li> Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in each nucleus. </li> <li> Chromosome is a highly coiled and condensed form of the 2.2 meters of DNA you have in each cell, and they’re generally formed during cell division.</li> <li> The 23rd pair is called the sex chromosomes; males have an XY combination of chromosomes and females have 2 X chromosomes- XX. The Y chromosome is much much smaller than the X chromosome (X ch contains around 900 genes, Y ch contains 63 genes). </li> </ul>

          <h1>The Epigenetics Revolution</h1> <h2>Nessa Carey</h2>
<h3>Some basic observations</h3> <ul>
          <li>Nutrition of unborn child (child is low weight if mother is malnourished in last stages of gestation; obese if malnourished in first stages of gestation)</li>
<li>An identical twin of a schizophrenic patient only has 50% of being schizophrenic.</li>
<li>Long term effects of childhood abuse well into adulthood </li></ul>
<p>Epigenetics- when genetically identical things appear different in a measurable manner => the modifications made to our genetic material that changes the way genes are switched on and off, without altering the genes themselves.</p>
<h3>Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT) experiments</h3>
<p>Do cells lose genes as they mature and differentiate? <ul>
<li>King and Briggs- transferred nucleus from an early development stage cell into the unfertilised egg (nucleus removed) of a frog => frog development took place. But no frog formed when they transferred nucleus from a more differentiated cell => concluded that genes are ‘lost’ during maturation </li>
<li>John Gurdon wanted to prove them wrong => inserted mutated adult cell nucleus into unfertilised African clawed toad => tadpoles were formed (egg cytoplasm adult nucleus)</li> </ul></p> <p>(Why amphibians- large eggs, released in water, large no. Of gametes, see through cells)</p>
<ul><li>Campbell and Wilmut used SCNT to clone Dolly the sheep (SCNT manual labour intense, mammals don’t produce a large no of eggs)</li></ul>
<p>Conrad Waddington- epigenetic landscape (refer to diagram)</p>
<p>Totipotency- can form EEM and embryo.
Pleuripotency- cannot form EEM (eg. ICM)</p>
<h3>Induced Pleuripotent Stem Cells (iPS cells)</h3>
<p>Shinza Yamanaka and Kazutoshi Takahashi took MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) and inserted a neomycin resistant genes that would activate only once the cell attains pleuripotency. (24 genes had already been identified as important in embryonic stem cells). Yamanaka showed that inserting 4 of these into MEF’s turned the MEF’s into embryonic stem cells (genetically and morphologically) and called these induced pleuripotency He then proved the same experiment in adult mouse fibroblasts.</p>
<p>The simplicity of this experiment was not recognised to be true, hence, it was rejected until the results were replicated by Rudolf Jaenisch (USA).</p>
<p>iPS cells <ul> <li> used to produce beta cells for diabetic mice.</li>
<li> US Dept. Of Defense funding RBC production</li></ul></p>
<p>Problem- normal cell reprogramming (fusion of sperm and egg results in sperm losing almost all its molecular memory) takes 36 hours. But Yamanaka’s best experiment took weeks to convert 1% of MEF’s to iPS cells. (Since the specific epigenetic signature of differentiated cells needs to be erased => egg can do that, but takes time)</p>
<h3>Why central dogma? </h3> <ul>
<li>DNA is sensitive and cannot be unzipped for long enough to code for proteins directly.</li>
<li>  Flexibility of potency. Eg. Alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme produced by liver increases when alcohol intake is high. This isn’t because the genes are replicated on the DNA, but because mRNA is copied multiple times.</li> </ul>
<h3>DNA Methylation (1st epigenetic modification discovered)</h3>
<p> Mostly only cytosine (followed by guanine) gets methylated (5-Methylcytosine) Cytosine followed by guanine is represented as CpG. </p>
<p>Enzymes that methylate CpG- DNA Methyl transferase DNMT 1, DNMT 3A, DNMT 3B </p>
<p>Godfather of DNA methylation- Adrian Bird</p>
